# 3D-Room-Designer
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary

Create an app for mobile devices to design rooms in 3D. After photographing a room (e.g. of a flat which the user plans to rent) as well as furniture from several sides the app determines the size of the room & the furniture and the user can place the furniture in the room as desired.

## Background

Someone who wants to rent a flat or house often has to look at several offers in a short time. After the visits with lot of different information the decision making as well as a more detailed planning is much easier and faster when one has not only a 3D image of the room(s) but also of the furniture which shall be placed there. 

## How is it used?

The user takes pictures of his/her furniture as well as of the room(s) they shall be placed in the future. The pictures have to be taken from different angles (most likely 2-3 angles) or by a videoscan so that the app can determine the size of the objects/rooms. Then the user can virtually place the furniture in the room. The user gets an almost real life 3D impression of the furbished room and can quickly find out if the existing furniture matches into the new room. This can be used before renting or buying a flat/house or when a user plans to change rooms within her/his existing flat/house. 

The user needs to have a mobile device with a high resolution camera as well as sufficient capacity for the app/images. Meanwhile most smartphones have these facilities.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data needed comes from the user him-/herself. AI methods can be used which are already used for measuring and body scan apps.

## Challenges

If a picture is taken of a foreign room, the user will have to ask the owner for permission to take pictures. Not every landlord might want that pictures are taken of his/her flat. 

## What next?

To create the app the relevant coding knowledge is needed for I am not a programmer (yet).
In the future interfaces could be implemented so that furniture companies could offer to immediately place their products in the room (open to every furniture company). In addition a functionality could be implemented by which users can print out a floor plan with the furniture in it so that moving companies can plan the delivery and place the furniture in the right place. A similar function could be used by moving companies to better plan the loading of the trucks.
